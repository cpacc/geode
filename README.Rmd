## Overview

**geode** is a software tool for mapping and analysis of geospatial data, designed in consultation with partners across the Canadian provincial and territorial cancer agencies.  Development of geode was motivated by a need for local information on cancer screening.

The flexible design of geode allows for a wide variety of geospatial work. The tool supports mapping and analysis of any geospatial boundary data available via shapefiles, any point locations identifiable as x-y positions (e.g., longitude and latitude), and any measures that can be assigned to regions (e.g., population size and density, age and sex distribution, counts and rates of disease or health conditions, socio-economic indicators, environmental health measures, etc.).  

Users of this tool are expected to have a basic understanding of the characteristics, limitations and use of geospatial data and the basic methods used in the analysis of such data.  

## Installation

You can install geode directly in R from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
